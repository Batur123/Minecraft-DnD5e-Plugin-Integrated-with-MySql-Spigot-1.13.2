# Minecraft-Roleplay-System

This plugin was tested on an online server with 35 people actively playing, and was successful with few errors. The server was using Spigot. The plugin was linked to our own server website (PHP). In this way, we were able to pull data over MySQL. Since the code is just a prototype, most of the code has not been optimized. It took about 3 weeks to write the code.

// Most of the events are in the /src/EventDosyasi/EventClass.java directory.
// Code is written with Java via Eclipse and IntellijIDEA IDE. Also used Bukkit and Spigot API.

It is role playing plugin which is players can select a job, level up, custom rolls, custom items. Database is MYSQL. So you can access it from PHP coded website.
